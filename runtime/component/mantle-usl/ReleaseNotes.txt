Mantle Business Artifacts - Universal Service Library Release Notes

===========================================================================
Release 1.0.2 - TBD
===========================================================================

Mantle Universal Service Library 1.0.2 is a minor new feature and bug fix
release.

This release is based on Moqui Framework TODO and mantle-udm TODO.

New Features

- Updated services in InventoryReportServices.xml to use new location for
  the search#CountBySource service in the moqui-elasticsearch component;
  note that this component is not needed for mantle-usl in general and is
  not a dependency, but is needed for these services
- Financial TimePeriod close now updated beginning and ending balances on
  all existing subsequent time periods
- On AcctgTrans (GL) posting beginning and ending balances for future
  existing time periods now updated
- Improved locking (avoid deadlocks, etc) and cleanups in GL posting
- Added reopen#FinancialTimePeriod service to open closed fiscal time
  periods, opposite of the corresponding open service; requires the
  FISCAL_REOPEN permission
- When posting an applied payment or payment application the receivable or
  payable GL account is determined based on the corresponding invoice so
  they always match
- The approve#Order service now requires the ORDER_APPROVE permission
- In add#OrderPartToShipment only item quantities not yet associated with a
  Shipment (not shipped quantities) are added
- OrderDisplayInfo now gets quantity not shipped, billed by item and part
- On Pack Shipment when invoice is created it is no longer put in
  Finalized status so it may be modified before Finalize and GL posting
- When Asset.quantityOnHandTotal goes below zero now does an automatic
  physical inventory found to get it back to zero
- Service updates for UDM replacement of EmplPosition.exemptFlag by
  taxExemptEnumId and taxFormId, and support for new
  PayrollAdjustmentExempt entity
- Changed create#PeriodWageAndTaxRecordsUsaIrs to
  create#PeriodWageAndTaxRecords now that it handles tax forms more
  generally with Employment.taxFormId, EmplPosition.taxFormId, and a new
  defaultTaxFormId parameter

Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with fiscal and other TimePeriod create when db time zone
  was very different from user time zone, now uses db time zone for date
  calculations
- Fixed issue where GL TX for Payment not reversed on Undeliver status
  transition (PmntDelivered to PmntPromised)

  tenant provisioning services in moqui-framework

  Assignee instead of Worker role, etc) and added services for a project
  progress report

  ID in square brackets)

  if not specified

Bug Fixes
