Mantle Business Artifacts - Universal Data Model Release Notes

===========================================================================
Release 1.0.2 - TBD
===========================================================================

Mantle Universal Data Model 1.0.2 is a minor new feature release.

This release is based on Moqui Framework TODO.

Non Backward Compatible Changes

- Agreement fromPartyId, fromRoleTypeId, toPartyId, toRoleTypeId fields
  replaced with organization and other (instead of from/to); the Agreement
  entities are not generally used, but any existing data/code would
  need to be moved/updated
- Changed FacilityContent, RequestContent, ProductCategoryContent,
  and ProductConfigItemContent to use a single PK field like other content
  entities; these entities are not currently used in services, etc but if
  used in custom code the code and existing data will need to be updated
- EmplPosition.exemptFlag replaced by taxExemptEnumId and taxFormId

New Features

- Set many entities to cache=never to avoid overhead of caching where
  read/write ratio doesn't justify it or where cache could cause issues
- Agreement and Term improvements
  - Refined TermType enums
  - Parties on Agreement are now organization and other instead of from/to
  - Added AgreementTerm termText and termNumber fields
  - New Settlement types for day of current or next month
- Added Enumeration type WorkType and workTypeEnumId to RateAmount,
  TimeEntry, WorkEffortParty, and replaced emplPositionClassId on
  WorkEffort work workTypeEnumId; this is useful for defining work types
  separate from position classes for a generally cleaner model and to
  better represent how position classes can have many work types
- Employment Tax Settings
  - Added Employment.taxFormId to override EmplPosition.taxFormId
  - Added PayrollAdjustmentExempt entity to configure exemptions based on
    EmplPosition.taxExemptEnumId
