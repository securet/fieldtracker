Moqui Runtime Release Notes

===========================================================================
Release 2.0.0 - TBD
===========================================================================

Moqui Runtime 2.0.0 is a major new feature and bug fix release, in parallel
with the release of Moqui Framework.

TODO

Non Backward Compatible Changes

- The webroot/assets directory and all libraries in it, including all Metis
  files, have been removed and replaced by updated and more limited
  JS/CSS libraries in webroot/lib
- All JS/CSS libraries used in the default XML Screen macros are included
  in moqui-runtime, while all libraries not used in XML Screen macros are
  moved to other components where they are used (ElFinder, Prism, Swagger
  UI in the tools component; FullCalendar in SimpleScreens; SimpleMDE and
  Sparkline in HiveMind)
- If you have explicit references to JS/CSS libraries from the assets
  directory in your code they will need to be updated to the new location
  under lib, and some libraries may need to be added to your component that
  are no longer in moqui-runtime
- Existing ScreenThemeResource records will need to be updated for new
  locations and removed for files that no longer exist (see the updated
  WebrootThemeData.xml file)
- The webroot.xml screen no longer adds any JS or CSS files leaving it
  clean for sub-screens outside of the apps.xml screen; this makes it
  easier to have other screen trees with very different web artifacts, but
  means any existing ones that are directly under webroot need to be
  updated to include scripts and stylesheets as needed (like PopCommerce)
- Export on Auto Screen master and entity Data Export now support a master
  name to export using master def for entities with one matching the name

New Features

- Updated Bootstrap to 3.3.6, jQuery to 2.2.2, jQuery UI to 1.11.4, Font
  Awesome to 4.5.0, jquery-form to 3.51.0, jquery-validation to 1.15.0,
  jsTree to 3.3.0, Moment to 2.12.0
- Removed Metis Admin Template files altogether, going back to plain
  Bootstrap and jQuery UI as a foundation
- Significant cleanups in JS/CSS libraries, in HTML produced in the default
  XML Screen macros, and in the webroot CSS files
- Now using Select2 (4.0.2) for dropdowns instead of Chosen
- Now using eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker (4.17.37) instead of
  smalot/bootstrap-datetimepicker for date and date/time widgets, and for
  time using simple text-line input with a regular expression to validate
- Split default.css file into webroot-layout.css and webroot-theme.css
  (with all fonts, colors, etc) to make more common theming easier
- Using icons instead of +/- characters for order-by links
- form-list pagination control now using Bootstrap pagination component,
  forward/backward icons, and has more convenient links
- Added password change and enable account to UserAccountDetail in System
- form-list now supports @header-dialog to put header-field widgets in a
  dialog instead of in the header
- form-list now supports @select-columns to allow users to select which
  fields are displayed in which columns, or not displayed
- Significant cleanups for form-list and form-single macros

Bug Fixes

- Fixed ElFinder rm (GitHub issue #23), and response for upload; also
  updated ElFinder in tools component to 2.1.11

Bug Fixes

Release 1.6.1 - 24 Jan 2016
===========================================================================

Moqui Runtime 1.6.1 is the first release of the runtime repository separate
from the rest of Moqui Framework.

Version numbers of this repository will match those of moqui-framework, the
two are developed in parallel. They are separate to make it easier to use
your runtime directory separate from the rest of the framework (for
configuration, custom UI, etc). The easiest way to do this is generally to
fork from this repository (moqui/moqui-runtime).
